# Deep Learning & Machine Learning
This is a collection of Kaggle notebooks in which either ML or DL techniques, or both, are applied to create an ML/AI model applied to various datasets. Sometimes, the performance of DL methods (involving neural networks such as ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, and their derivatives) are compared against those of ML (e.g. XGBoost, RandomForest,  SVM, etc). This repository will be updated occasionally to include more notebooks. Currently, the list of notebooks includes:

1. Stellar classification: ANN/CNN v XGBClassifier

2. ANN/CNN/RandomForest: Predicting nice weather

3. Spark tree-based methods: Weather prediction

   This notebook uses the same dataset as the #2 notebook above, but Spark ML library was used to create an ML model
