# Kaggle_Deep_Learning_vs_Machine_Learning
This is a collection of Kaggle notebooks in which the performance of deep learning methods (involving neural networks such as ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, and their derivatives) are compared against those of machine learning (e.g. XGBoost, RandomForest,  SVM, etc). This repository will be updated occasionally to include more notebooks. Currently, the list of notebooks includes:

1. Stellar classification: ANN/CNN v XGBClassifier
